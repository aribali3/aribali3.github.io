          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I wrote a program where data flows between a
            number of classes and different classes communicate and collaborate
            with each other. The program goes through a list of applicants, and
            either place each person in their new home or reject them, according
            to certain criteria. The information of applicants and planets was
            given in a file which was parsed and the extracted information was
            placed in an ArrayQueue.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul class="alt">
            <li>
              To track the movement of people, data structures, interfaces,
              encapsulation, and File I/O were utilized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Test Driven Development was utilized and JUnit tests were written
              to throughly test the program.
